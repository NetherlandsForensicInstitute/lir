# glass.yaml - an example LR system evaluation for glass data.
#
# This file features two common-source systems for evaluation on glass data: a score-based system and a features-based
# system.
#
# Usage: pdm run lir --setup examples/glass.yaml
#

# Output will be written to the folder specified below. There will be a sub folder for each experiment. The sub folders
# each contain a file named `metrics.csv` which contains the metrics for each LR system that is tested, and for each LR
# system there is a folder that may contain visualizations and other by products.

# We use a pre-defined dataset of LA-ICP-MS measurements of elemental concentration from floatglass. For more
# information on the dataset, see: https://github.com/NetherlandsForensicInstitute/elemental_composition_glass
#
# This requires internet access on first run to fetch the data. Subsequent runs will use the cached data in `cache_dir`.
# The data consist of a pre-defined training/test set combination. The training data has three instances per source; the
# test data has five instances per source, from which to draw two-to-three pairs for LR calculations.

# This defines a score-based LR system. We may later experiment with different parameter values by augmenting this
# system.
score_based_lr_system:
  # The `score_based` architecture takes three arguments:
  # - `preprocessing`: a pipeline of modules that takes instance features as input and may do some preprocessing;
  # - `pairing`: a pairing method that takes instances as input and produces same-source and different-source pairs;
  # - `comparing`: a pipeline of modules that takes pairs as input and produces LLRs.
  #
  # A module may be a scikit-learn-style transformer, an estimator or a function.
  # A module always has a `method` argument which defines the module class, which may be a scikit-learn-style
  # transformer, estimator or a plain function. All other arguments are passed to the module class on instantiation,
  # like this:
  #
  # scaler:
  #   method: standard_scaler
  #   with_mean: False
  #
  # Alternatively, if the module needs no arguments, the module class can be entered directly. The modules `scaler1` and
  # `scaler2` in the following snippet are equivalent.
  #
  # scaler1:
  #   method: standard_scaler
  # scaler2: standard_scaler
  #
  architecture: score_based

  preprocessing:
    method: debug_pipeline  # generate a CSV file containing the output of each processing step
    steps:
      scaler: standard_scaler  # apply the scikit-learn `StandardScaler` with default arguments

  pairing:
    method: instance_pairs
    ratio_limit: 1  # limit the number of different-source pairs to the number of same-source pairs

  comparing:
    method: debug_pipeline
    steps:
      scoring: abs_diff  # calculate the absolute difference between the two instances for each feature
      clf: logistic_regression  # use scikit-learn `LogisticRegression` to estimate probabilities
      to_llr: probabilities_to_logodds  # convert probabilities to their log-odds values
      calibration:  # calibrate the log-odds to LLRs using KDE
        method: kde
        bandwidth: silverman
      bounding: elub_bounder  # prevent excessive extrapolation by applying an LLR bounder

two_level_lr_system:
  # The `two_level` architecture takes three arguments:
  # - `preprocessing`: a pipeline that takes instance features as input and may do some preprocessing;
  # - `pairing`: a pairing method that takes instances as input and produces same-source and different-source pairs;
  # - `postprocessing`: a pipeline that takes LLRs as input and may do some postprocessing.

# Below we define how the LR system should be evaluated. We define three experiments:
#
# - `model_selection` does a grid search on parameters of the score-based system;
# - `architecture_evaluation` compares the two architectures, score-based and two-level (feature-based);
# - `validation` evaluates just a single LR system.
#
experiments:

  # Each experiment has a required argument `strategy`. All other values are parameters of the strategy. The grid search
  # strategy `grid` takes the following arguments:
  #
  # - `lr_system` -- the base LR system
  # - `data` -- the data to be used for evaluation
  # - `hyperparameters` -- the hyperparameters that are varied
  # - `metrics` -- the metrics to be included in the summary `metrics.csv`
  # - `visualization` -- how to visualize the results
  #
  # The hyperparameter block has a list of hyperparameters. Each hyperparameter has a list of *options*, and their
  # values are substituted in the base configuration of the LR system. Where exactly the values are substituted is
  # defined by the *path* in the base configuration.
  #
  # For example, the path to the `standard_scaler` in the `score_based_lr_system` is "preprocessing.steps.scaler". The scaler
  # can be defined as a categorical hyperparameter as follows.
  #
  # ```
  # hyperparameters:
  #   - name: scaling method  # optional, defaults to `path`
  #     path: preprocessing.steps.scaler
  #     options:
  #       - standard_scaler
  #       - min_max_scaler
  # ```
  #
  # Alternatively, you may want to substitute several paths as a *cluster*. For example, the calibration settings may
  # depend on which classifier is used. In this case, don't include the `path` under the hyperparameter definition, but
  # declare *substitutions* for each option, like so.
  #
  # ```
  # hyperparameters:
  #   - name: clf
  #     options:
  #       - option_name: svm_and_kde
  #         substitutions:
  #           - path: comparing.steps.clf
  #             value:
  #               method: svm
  #               probability: True
  #           - path: comparing.steps.calibration
  #             value:
  #               method: kde
  #               bandwidth: silverman
  #       - option_name: logit
  #         substitutions:
  #           - path: comparing.steps.clf
  #             value: logistic_regression
  #           - path: comparing.steps.calibration
  #             value: csv_writer
  # ```
  #
  # The hyperparameter value may also be numerical, as follows.
  #
  # ```
  # hyperparameters:
  #   - name: kde_bandwidth
  #     path: comparing.steps.calibration.bandwidth
  #     low: .1
  #     high: 1
  #     log: False
  #     step: .1
  # ```
  #
  # The appropriate hyperparameter type is inferred from its declaration. It may also be declared explicitly by adding
  # a `type` field with the corresponding value `categorical`, `cluster`, or `float`.
