# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide outlines the process for reporting issues, proposing features, and submitting pull requests.

## 1. Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- Reporting bugs
- Requesting new features
- Improving documentation
- Submitting code via pull requests
- Testing or reviewing existing PRs

## 2. Issues

- Check existing issues before opening a new one
- Use clear titles and detailed descriptions
- Include steps to reproduce bugs whenever possible
- If applicable, please add appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`)
  - There are multiple project specific labels as well, e.g. `module:plotting`

## 3. Working on New Features

- Discuss large changes in an issue before starting development
- Create a dedicated branch, e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`
- Keep your code consistent with the project’s style and structure

## 4. Pull Requests

- Make sure your fork/branch is up to date with the `main` branch
- Provide a clear explanation of what the PR does and why
- Add tests if the project includes test coverage
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Keep PRs small and focused to make reviews easier

## 5. Code Style & Conventions

- Follow the project’s established coding standards as configured in `pyproject.toml`
  - This project recommends using `pdm` as the preferred package manager, which provides access to `pdm run all`, performing the checks automatically.
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Add comments or documentation where necessary

## 6. Documentation

- Update documentation when adding or modifying functionality
- Modify the README, wiki, or inline documentation as needed

## 7. Releases

- Releases are handled by the maintainers
- All releases follow semantic versioning: `major.minor.patch`

## 8. Contact

- If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue
