        An implementation of the two-level model as outlined in FSI191(2009)42 by Bolck et al. "Different likelihood
        ratio approaches to evaluate the strength of evidence of MDMA tablet comparisons".

        Model description:

        Definitions
        X_ij = vector, measurement of reference j, ith repetition, with i=1..n
        Y_kl = vector, measurement of trace l, kth repetition, with k=1..m

        Model:

        First level of variance:
        X_ij ~ N(theta_j, sigma_within)
        Y_kl ~ N(theta_k, sigma_within)
        where theta_j is the true but unknown mean of the reference and theta_k the true but unknown mean of the trace.
        sigma_within is assumed equal for trace and reference (and for repeated measurements of some background data)

        Second level of variance:
        theta_j ~ theta_k ~ KDE(means background database, h)
        with h the kernel bandwidth.

        H1: theta_j = theta_k
        H2: theta_j independent of theta_k

        Numerator LR = Integral_theta N(X_Mean|theta, sigma_within, n) * N(Y_mean|theta, sigma_within, m) * \
            KDE(theta|means background database, h)

            Integral_theta N(Y_Mean|theta, sigma_within, m) * KDE(theta|means background database, h)

        In Bolck et al. in the appendix one finds a closed-form solution for the evaluation of these integrals.

        sigma_within and h (and other parameters) are estimated from repeated measurements of background data.
